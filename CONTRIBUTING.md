# Contribution GuidelinesðŸ“ƒ

This documentation contains guidelines that should be followed while making your contribution(s):

- If you have any feature that you'd love to be added to the app or you noticed any bug, kindly use these [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) to open an issue.

- If you have been assigned an issue, endeavour to create a new branch and make your changes. For your code to be merged, refrain from pushing from the main branch.

- Upon making a pull request, your pull request should only contain a change at a time. Raise different pull requests for the other changes you will like to make.

- Kindly be informed that any PR that modifies someone else's lines(s) of code won't be merged unless it is absolutely necessary.

- When writing your commit messages, keep it short and concise. Also, write your commit messages in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

- Contributions or any kind will be much appreciated too, be it fixing grammatical errors, fixing broken links, etc. If the contribution is  minimal, go ahead to create a pull request, else raise an issue before making your contribution.

- Finally, if you are just getting started to open-source contributions, here is a [repository](https://github.com/Mannuel25/Nutshell-GitHub) that could come in handy.

#### Happy Contribution ðŸš€
